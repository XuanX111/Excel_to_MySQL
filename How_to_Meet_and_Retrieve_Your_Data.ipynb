    "* Start by joining no more than two tables.  After you have made sure the query works as written and that the output makes sense, add other tables one at a time, checking the new query and its results each time.\n",
    "* Your final output should have 244 rows.  Given the limited output, the easiest way to extract the results will be to copy and paste the output from your query into Excel, although you could also extract as a .csv file and open that with Excel.  If you choose the .csv option, you might find it necessary to write your query on multiple lines when you declare it as a variable.  To do this, type a space (if you forget the space the lines will run together) and a \"\\\" at the end of each line of your query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_data= %sql SELECT DISTINCT user_guid, state, membership_type \\\n",
    "FROM users \\\n",
    "WHERE country=\"US\" AND state IS NOT NULL and membership_type IS NOT NULL \\\n",
    "ORDER BY state ASC, membership_type ASC ;\n",
    "\n",
    "my_data.csv('my_data.csv')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* We recommend that you calculate the occupancy rates of the example short-term rental properties within MySQL, rather than within Excel (it will be much faster!)  To do this, only examine rental dates during 2015, and remember that there are 365 days in the year.  The final output of your calculation should be the percentage of days in 2015 that the property was occupied.  You may want to consider using a subquery for this calculation.\n",
    "* Make sure that you extract information from short-term rentals <u>**_that have the same location and property type_**</u> as the 244 Watershed properties.\n",
    "* If you run into trouble, use your workbooks and Teradata notes from “Managing Big Data with MySQL” to remind you how to implement different parts of your query.\n",
